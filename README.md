# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This is an Employee Payroll Tracker to log employees(First Name, Last Name) and their salary. 
When the Add Employee button is clicked a window prompts the user to add an Employee first name, another window prompts the user to add the employee's last name, another window prompts the user to add the employee's salary. Finally a fourth window asks the user to confirm if they would like to continue entering employees. This function will continue to loop untill the user clicks cancel at any point.
The tracker will also log the average salary into the console once the Employee Roster is complete.
The tracker will also log a random employee into the console once the Employee Roster is complete.
